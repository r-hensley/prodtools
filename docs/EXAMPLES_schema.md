# EXAMPLES.md schema

This file is the source of truth for `EXAMPLES.md`. The `/refresh-examples`
slash command reads this schema + the current code and regenerates
`EXAMPLES.md` from scratch. Edit this file to change the shape, tone, or
preserved caveats of the generated doc. Do not hand-edit `EXAMPLES.md` —
changes will be overwritten on the next refresh.

## Purpose

`EXAMPLES.md` is a usage reference for the Python-based Mu2e production
tools. A reader with an active Mu2e environment should be able to copy any
command from it and have it run.

## Audience

Mu2e collaborators running production workflows — mix of experts and
newcomers. Assume familiarity with `art`, `FCL`, `SAM`, `POMS`, and the
`mu2e` executable. Do not assume familiarity with this repo's internals.

## Tone

Terse and example-first. Every command block is a real invocation the
reader can paste. Explanations follow the commands, not the other way
around. No marketing language, no "powerful", no emojis.

## Sources of truth

When regenerating, read in this order:

1. **This schema** (sections, caveats, anti-patterns below).
2. **CLI surface** — `argparse` definitions in `utils/*.py` and
   `bin/*` entry points. Every documented flag must exist in the current
   code. Every command must be runnable as written.
3. **Module docstrings** in `utils/*.py` and `bin/*`. Treat docstrings as
   canonical for tool purpose.
4. **JSON config schemas** under `data/` — enumerate the keys actually
   consumed by `utils/config_utils.py`, `utils/mixing_utils.py`,
   `utils/prod_utils.py`. Do not invent keys.
5. **Existing tests** under `test/` for working examples.
6. **Recent git log** — `git log --oneline -20` for context on new
   features that may not yet have examples.

## Required sections (in order)

1. **Environment Setup** — cvmfs source line, `muse setup ops`, optional
   `bin/setup.sh`, what becomes available.
2. **Overview** — two bullet lists: core production tools, analysis /
   diagnostic tools. One line each.
3. **Creating Job Definitions (`json2jobdef`, `jobdef`)** — JSON-based
   (recommended) and direct `jobdef` invocations. Cover stage-1, resampler,
   mixing shapes.
4. **Random sampling in input data** — the `{"count": N, "random": true}`
   form and its deterministic-seed guarantee. Mention the optional
   `"max_nfiles": M` cap inside the same nested-dict value (positive int;
   non-random branch slices `sorted(files)[:M]`; random branch bounds
   `total_needed`; `njobs` is NOT auto-recomputed).
5. **FCL Generation (`jobfcl`, `fcldump`)** — from jobdef tarball, from
   dataset name, from target output filename. Include `--local-jobdef`.
6. **Mixing Jobs** — JSON schema with `pileup_datasets` list-of-dict form,
   automatic mixer mapping. Do not use the legacy `*_dataset` / `*_count`
   split form.
7. **Production Execution (`runmu2e`)** — role of `fname`
   env var, `etc.mu2e.index.NNN.NNNNNNN.txt` format, dry-run flag.
8. **Sequential vs. pseudo-random auxiliary input selection** — the
   `tbs.sequential_aux` flag.
9. **FCL overrides** — `fcl_overrides` dict, how template + `--embed`
    works, that base FCL stays unexpanded.
10. **Parity Tests** — `test/parity_test.sh` usage.
11. **Additional Tools** — one subsection per script in `bin/` that has
    user-facing CLI: `pomsMonitor`, `pomsMonitorWeb`, `famtree`,
    `logparser`, `genFilterEff`, `datasetFileList`, `listNewDatasets`,
    `latestDatasets`, `mkrecovery`, `mkidxdef`, `jobquery`,
    `submit_map`, `copy_to_stash`. Ops scripts
    (`install_prodtools.sh`, `update_pomsmonitor_web`) get a one-line
    mention. Each subsection: one-line purpose, 1–3 example invocations,
    key flags. Enumerate from the current `bin/` directory — add any new
    script found there, remove any that no longer exist. (`runjob.sh` is
    a worker bootstrap, not user-facing — omit.)
12. **Troubleshooting** — only entries that correspond to real error
    messages produced by current code. Remove stale ones.

## Tribal knowledge to preserve (non-derivable from code)

Include these verbatim or equivalent — they are NOT derivable from
reading the code:

- `muse setup SimJob` is optional for most tools; only `muse setup ops`
  is required.
- The `etc.mu2e.index.000.NNNNNNN.txt` filename in `fname` encodes the
  job index — the seventh-field `NNNNNNN` (the **sequencer**) is the
  job index, zero-padded to 7 digits. `mkrecovery` writes these as
  `etc.mu2e.index.000.{idx:07d}.txt`. The `000` field is a fixed
  description placeholder, not the index.
- `inloc` accepts `disk`, `tape`, `scratch`, `resilient`, `stash`,
  `none`, or `dir:<path>` (locally-mounted FS, e.g. cvmfs). There is no
  `auto`. `resilient` reads via xrootd, `stash` reads via CVMFS, and
  `dir:` reads via direct POSIX (the `file:` protocol is forced).
- Random sampling seed is derived from `(owner, desc, dsconf, dataset,
  count, njobs)` — same inputs always produce the same file selection.
- Parity tests validate byte-for-byte equivalence against the Perl
  `mu2ejobdef` reference implementation.
- `pomsMonitor` database default path is `poms_data.db` at the repo root
  (`db_analyzer.get_default_db_path`).
- `genFilterEff` output is Proditions-compatible (`TABLE
  SimEfficiencies2`).
- `famtree` auto-excludes `etc*.txt` files from diagrams.

If any of the above stops being true, update this list — do not leave a
stale caveat in the regenerated doc.

## Rules for examples

- Every JSON config snippet must round-trip through the current
  `json2jobdef` loader without error. If unsure, shell out and verify.
- Every CLI flag shown must appear in the current `argparse` for that
  tool. When in doubt, read the source — do not guess.
- Prefer campaign names that appear in current files under `data/` (as
  of the regen). Do not use a campaign name if no JSON under `data/`
  references it.
- File paths in examples must follow the current Mu2e naming convention:
  `tier.owner.description.dsconf.sequencer.extension`.
- Keep one canonical example per feature. Do not show five variants of
  the same invocation.

## Anti-patterns (do not include)

- Speculative future features ("coming soon", "planned").
- Commands that were true for a past release but not the current code.
- Internal implementation details unless they affect the user (e.g.,
  "uses ThreadPoolExecutor" — only mention if the user sees the effect).
- Benchmarks or performance numbers (these rot fastest).
- References to `mu2e_poms_util` (old package name). The current package
  is `utils/` under `prodtools/`.

## Output constraints

- File goes to `EXAMPLES.md` at repo root. Overwrite entirely.
- Use GitHub-flavored markdown. Code blocks must carry a language tag
  (`bash`, `json`, `python`, `fcl`).
- Section numbering must be contiguous — no gaps (the current
  `EXAMPLES.md` jumps from 5 to 7; the regen must fix this).
- No footer claiming what commit produced this file — git already tracks
  that.
